## A Simplified Architecture

The Open Source version is designed as a **Single-Workspace System**. This means one deployment serves one business. This architecture prioritizes simplicity, ease of deployment, and total data ownerhsip.

## Core Capabilities

- **Inspector Dashboard**: Manage your jobs, clients, and reports in one place.
- **Online Booking**: A built-in public scheduler with Turnstile bot protection.
- **Mobile Field Form**: Collect data on-site with a mobile-first, offline-capable form.
- **Professional Reports**: Branded HTML reports with e-signatures and payment integration.
- **AI-Powered Assistance**: Use Gemini AI to refine your comments and generate defect summaries.

### 1. Zero-Setup (Web-First)
The fastest way to get started. No local Node.js required:
1. Click the **Deploy to Cloudflare** button above.
2. Follow the Cloudflare dashboard prompts to create your D1 database and KV namespace.
3. Once deployed, visit your Worker URL (e.g., `https://openinspection.workers.dev/setup`).
4. A 6-digit setup code will be automatically generated and logged by the system. Enter this code to initialize your admin account.

> **Note**: If you don't see the setup code in your deployment logs, run `npm run setup:cloudflare -- --refresh-setup-code` after deployment to generate a new one.


### 2. Automated Install (CLI-First)
Recommended for developers who want to manage the system via terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/InspectorHub/OpenInspection
cd OpenInspection
npm install
npm run setup:cloudflare
```

The script will create your database (D1), object storage (R2), and configuration cache (KV) automatically.

### 2. Manual Configuration
1. Set `SINGLE_TENANT_ID = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"` in your `wrangler.toml`.
2. Apply database migrations: `npm run db:migrate:remote`.
3. Deploy your worker: `npm run deploy`.
