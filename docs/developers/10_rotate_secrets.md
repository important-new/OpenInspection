# Rotating JWT keys

OpenInspection's auth surface has one rotating secret:

1. **JWT signing keys** — ES256 keypairs in a multi-version keyring (`JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_V<N>` / `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_V<N>` + `JWT_CURRENT_KID`).

> **Note:** M2M authentication between core and portal previously used HMAC shared secrets (`PORTAL_M2M_SECRET_V<N>`). This has been replaced by Cloudflare Service Bindings — no shared secrets, no rotation needed. See `src/portal/README.md`.

The JWT keyring supports zero-downtime overlap rotation. Operators run one script; users do not notice.

## When to rotate

Rotation is **event-driven**, not scheduled. Trigger on any of:

- Suspected key compromise (wrangler API token leaked, suspicious deploy, logs leaked)
- Team member departure if they ever had `wrangler login` to this account
- Annual review / compliance milestone
- Long stretch since last rotation (1–2 years)

There is no business reason to rotate on a fixed cron — these aren't access tokens. Skip "weekly rotation" cargo-culting.

## JWT keypair rotation

### Procedure

```bash
cd apps/core

# 1. Mint a new keypair, push to all 5 worker targets, bump JWT_CURRENT_KID
npm run rotate:jwt

# 2. Redeploy both workers so they pick up the new env var bindings
npm run deploy           # openinspection-api (OSS one-click default)
npm run deploy:standalone # openinspection-api (test environment, real CF IDs)
npm run deploy:saas      # openinspection-saas-api
cd ../portal && npm run deploy

# 3. Wait at least the maximum JWT TTL since rotation
#    (default ~24h; check your auth.ts setExpirationTime() value)

# 4. Prune the previous kid
cd ../core
node scripts/rotate-jwt-keys.js --prune-old-kid=v<old>
```

What happens during the overlap window: workers hold BOTH `v<old>` and `v<new>` keypairs. New tokens are signed with `v<new>` (the current kid). Existing tokens signed with `v<old>` still verify because `v<old>` is still in the keyring. Once max-TTL elapses, no in-flight tokens reference `v<old>` anymore, so it's safe to prune.

### Dry-run preview

```bash
node scripts/rotate-jwt-keys.js --dry-run
```

Prints the new keypair (truncated) and the wrangler commands that would be issued. No actual changes.

## First-time setup

On a fresh deploy with no keys provisioned, run the rotation script once. The "no current kid → start at v1" branch handles it:

```bash
npm run rotate:jwt    # mints JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_V1 + JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_V1 + sets JWT_CURRENT_KID=v1
```

Then deploy both workers. They start with v1 immediately.

## Emergency rotation (active compromise)

Skip the overlap window — accept the user impact:

```bash
# 1. Rotate
npm run rotate:jwt

# 2. Deploy immediately
cd ../portal && npm run deploy
cd ../core && npm run deploy && npm run deploy:saas

# 3. Prune the old kid right away (no waiting)
node scripts/rotate-jwt-keys.js --prune-old-kid=v<old>
```

Users with existing JWTs get 401 on their next request and re-login. Containment beats UX.

## Verifying a rotation worked

After deploying with new secrets:

```bash
# Per worker target, confirm new env vars are populated
npx wrangler secret list                              # standalone
npx wrangler secret list -c wrangler.saas.toml        # saas
cd ../portal && npx wrangler secret list              # portal

# Each should now show JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_V<NEW>, JWT_PUBLIC_KEY_V<NEW>,
# JWT_CURRENT_KID = v<NEW>
```

Functional check:

1. Hit `/login` on a deployed worker, log in. Cookie set. Visit a protected route → 200.
2. Trigger a portal→core call (e.g. provision a test tenant via portal console → OnboardingWorkflow calls core via Service Binding). Verify the call returns 2xx.

## Failure recovery

### "wrangler secret put failed mid-rotation on one of 5 targets"

Re-run the rotation script. It's idempotent — same target gets pushed the same value. If the failure was network/timeout, retry is safe.

### "JWT_CURRENT_KID set but private key missing"

`buildKeyring()` throws on startup. Worker returns 5xx on every request. Push the missing var:

```bash
npx wrangler secret put JWT_PRIVATE_KEY_V<N>  # from .dev.vars or a fresh keypair if .dev.vars was lost
```

### "Pruned a kid too early; still-valid tokens in flight"

Re-mint and re-push the same kid:

```bash
# Get the PEMs from your local .dev.vars (if still there) or generate fresh
# Push them under the same V<N> name to restore the keyring
```

Users hit by the gap re-login; the gap is bounded by how long ago you pruned.

### "Wrangler login expired during rotation"

Run `wrangler logout && wrangler login` to refresh OAuth token. Re-run the rotation script — it picks up where it left off (idempotent).

## What's NOT in scope

- **JWT_SECRET** (the legacy env var) is no longer used for JWT signing. It's still active as KDF input for `config-crypto`, `qbo-crypto`, and audit signing-key encryption. Rotating it requires a separate procedure (data re-encryption) not covered here.
- **CF account API token** (the OAuth credential `wrangler login` provisions) — rotate via `wrangler logout && wrangler login`. Operational hygiene, not in this runbook.
- **Stripe / Resend / Google API keys** — vendor-side rotation; follow each vendor's docs.

## Script reference

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run rotate:jwt` | New ES256 keypair → push V<N+1> → bump JWT_CURRENT_KID |
| `node scripts/rotate-jwt-keys.js --dry-run` | Preview without pushing |
| `node scripts/rotate-jwt-keys.js --prune-old-kid=v1` | Remove V1 from all targets |
