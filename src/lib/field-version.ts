/**
 * Design System 0520 subsystem B phase 3 — field-version conflict helpers.
 *
 * Pure decision functions consumed by InspectionService.patchItem and
 * InspectionService.patchPropertyFact (and by extension the conflict
 * surfaces in ConflictModal). Isolating the version arithmetic here lets
 * the service layer focus on DB read/write while these helpers stay
 * trivially testable without any test fixtures.
 *
 * Field layout (per spec §"JSON-shape changes — no DDL"):
 *   data[itemId] = {
 *       <field>:     <value>,
 *       <field>_v:   number,    // monotonic, +1 per successful write
 *       <field>_by:  string,    // userId of last writer
 *       <field>_at:  number,    // epoch seconds of last write
 *   }
 *
 * A legacy entry missing the `<field>_v` suffix is treated as version 0,
 * which is what the offline-queue replay path sends as its initial
 * expectedVersion. That preserves backwards-compatibility with pre-
 * subsystem-B inspection_results rows without a migration backfill.
